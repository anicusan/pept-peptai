'''The `peptml` package implements a hierarchical density-based clustering
algorithm for general Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT).

The PEPT-ML algorithm [1] works using the following steps:
    1. Split the data into a series of individual "samples", each containing
    a given number of LoRs. Use the base class pept.LineData for this.
    2. For every sample of LoRs, compute the *cutpoints*, or the points in
    space that minimise the distance to every pair of lines.
    3. Cluster every sample using HDBSCAN and extract the centres of the
    clusters ("1-pass clustering").
    4. Split the centres into samples of a given size.
    5. Cluster every sample of centres using HDBSCAN and extract the centres
    of the clusters ("2-pass clustering").
    6. Construct the trajectory of every particle using the centres from the
    previous step.

A typical workflow for using the `peptml` package would be:
    1. Read the LoRs into a `pept.LineData` class instance and set the
    `sample_size` and `overlap` appropriately.
    2. Compute the cutpoints using the `pept.tracking.peptml.Cutpoints` class.
    3. Instantiate an `pept.tracking.peptml.HDBSCANClusterer` class and cluster
    the cutpoints found previously.

More tutorials and examples can be found on the University of Birmingham
Positron Imaging Centre's GitHub repository.

PEPT-ML was successfuly used at the University of Birmingham to analyse real
Fluorine-18 tracers in air.
