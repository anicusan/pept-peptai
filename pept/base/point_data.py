class PointData(IterableSamples):
    '''A class for generic PEPT data iteration, manipulation and visualisation.

    This class is used to encapsulate points. It can yield samples of the
    `point_data` of an adaptive `sample_size` and `overlap`, without requiring
    additional storage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point_data : (N, M) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 4) numpy array that stores points (or any generic 2D set of
        data). It expects that the first column is time, followed by cartesian
        (3D) coordinates of points **in mm**, followed by any extra information
        the user needs. A row is then [time, x, y, z, etc].
    sample_size : int, optional
        An `int`` that defines the number of points that should be returned
        when iterating over `point_data`. A `sample_size` of 0 yields all the
        data as one single sample. Default is 0.
    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples that
        are returned when iterating over `point_data`. An overlap of 0 means
        consecutive samples, while an overlap of (`sample_size` - 1) means
        incrementing the samples by one. A negative overlap means skipping
        values between samples. An error is raised if `overlap` is larger than
        or equal to `sample_size`. Default is 0.
    verbose : bool, optional
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the initialisation
        of an instance of the class. Useful when reading large files (10gb
        files for PEPT data is not unheard of). Default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    point_data : (N, M) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 4) numpy array that stores the points as time, followed by
        cartesian (3D) coordinates of the point **in mm**, followed by any
        extra information. Each row is then `[time, x, y, z, etc]`.
    sample_size : int
        An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be returned when
        iterating over `point_data`. Default is 0.
    overlap : int
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples that
        are returned when iterating over `point_data`. An overlap of 0 means
        consecutive samples, while an overlap of (`sample_size` - 1) means
        incrementing the samples by one. A negative overlap means skipping
        values between samples. It is required to be smaller than
        `sample_size`. Default is 0.
    number_of_points : int
        An `int` that corresponds to len(`point_data`), or the number of points
        stored by `point_data`.
    number_of_samples : int
        An `int` that corresponds to the number of samples that can be accessed
        from the class, taking the `overlap` into consideration.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size`. Overlap is required to be smaller than
        `sample_size`, unless `sample_size` is 0. Note that it can also be
        negative.
    ValueError
        If `line_data` does not have (N, M) shape, where M >= 4.

    Notes
    -----
    The class saves `point_data` as a **contiguous** numpy array for efficient
    access in C / Cython functions. The inner data can be mutated, but do not
    change the number of rows or columns after instantiating the class.

        Returns a `plotly.graph_objects.Scatter3d` trace containing all points
        included in in the samples selected by `sample_indices`.
        `sample_indices` can be a single sample index (e.g. 0) or an iterable
        of indices (e.g. [1,5,6]).

        Can then be passed to the `plotly.graph_objects.figure.add_trace`
        function or a `PlotlyGrapher` instance using the `add_trace` method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_indices : int or iterable
            The index or indices of the samples of LoRs. The default is 0
            (the first sample).
        size : float
            The marker size of the points. The default is 2.
        color : str or list-like
            Can be a single color (e.g. "black", "rgb(122, 15, 241)") or a
            colorbar list. Is ignored if `colorbar` is set to True. For more
            information, check the Plotly documentation. The default is None.
        opacity : float
            The opacity of the lines, where 0 is transparent and 1 is fully
            opaque. The default is 0.8.
        colorbar : bool
            If set to True, will color-code the data in the sample column
            `colorbar_col`. Overrides `color` if set to True. The default is
            False.
        colorbar_col : int
            The column in the data samples that will be used to color the
            points. Only has an effect if `colorbar` is set to True. The
            default is -1 (the last column).
        colorbar_title : str
            If set, the colorbar will have this title above. The default is
            None.

        Returns
