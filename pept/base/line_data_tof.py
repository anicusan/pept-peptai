class LineDataToF(IterableSamples):
    '''A class for PEPT-ToF LoR data iteration, manipulation and visualisation.

    Generally, PEPT LoRs are lines in 3D space, each defined by two points,
    irrespective of the geometry of the scanner used. This class is used
    for LoRs (or any lines!) encapsulation. It can yield samples of the
    `line_data` of an adaptive `sample_size` and `overlap`, without requiring
    additional storage.

    Note that the spatial and temporal data must have self-consistent units
    (i.e. millimetres and milliseconds OR metres and seconds). Also, besides
    the expected [time1, x1, y1, z1, time2, x2, y2, z2] columns, any extra
    information can be appended after the two points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_data : (N, M >= 8) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 8) numpy array that stores the PEPT LoRs with Time of
        Flight (ToF) data (or any generic set of lines with two timestamps) as
        individual time and cartesian (3D) coordinates of two points defining
        each line, **in mm**. A row is then [t1, x1, y1, z1, t2, x2, y2, z2].
    sample_size : int, optional
        An `int`` that defines the number of lines that should be returned when
        iterating over `line_data`. A `sample_size` of 0 yields all the data as
        one single sample. Default is 0.
    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples that
        are returned when iterating over `line_data`. An overlap of 0 means
        consecutive samples, while an overlap of (`sample_size` - 1) means
        incrementing the samples by one. A negative overlap means skipping
        values between samples. An error is raised if `overlap` is larger than
        or equal to `sample_size`. Default is 0.
    verbose : bool, optional
        An option that enables printing the time taken for the initialisation
        of an instance of the class. Useful when reading large files (10gb
        files for PEPT data is not unheard of). Default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : (N, M >= 8) numpy.ndarray
        An (N, M >= 8) numpy array that stores the PEPT LoRs as individual
        times (**in ms**) and cartesian (3D) coordinates of two points defining
        a line, **in mm**. Each row is then
        `[time1, x1, y1, z1, time2, x2, y2, z2]`.
    sample_size : int
        An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be returned when
        iterating over `line_data`. Default is 0.
    overlap : int
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples that
        are returned when iterating over `line_data`. An overlap of 0 implies
        consecutive samples, while an overlap of (`sample_size` - 1) implies
        incrementing the samples by one. A negative overlap means skipping
        values between samples. It is required to be smaller than
        `sample_size`. Default is 0.
    number_of_lines : int
        An `int` that corresponds to len(`line_data`), or the number of LoRs
        stored by `line_data`.
    number_of_samples : int
        An `int` that corresponds to the number of samples that can be accessed
        from the class. It takes `overlap` into consideration.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size` unless `sample_size` is 0. Overlap
        has to be smaller than `sample_size`. Note that it can also be
        negative.
    ValueError
        If `line_data` has fewer than 8 columns.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is made for LoRs that also have Time of Flight data, such that
    every row in `line_data` is comprised of two points defining a line along
    with their individual timestamps: [time1, x1, y1, z1, time2, x2, y2, z2].
    If your PET / PEPT scanner does not have Time of Flight data, use the
    `LineData` class.

    The class saves `line_data` as a **contiguous** numpy array for efficient
    access in C / Cython functions. The inner data can be mutated, but do not
    change the number of rows or columns after instantiating the class.

        ----------
        sample_indices : int or iterable or Ellipsis

        width : float
            The width of the lines. The default is 2.
        color : str or list-like
            Can be a single color (e.g. "black", "rgb(122, 15, 241)") or a
            colorbar list. Overrides `colorbar` if set. For more information,
            check the Plotly documentation. The default is None.
        opacity : float
            The opacity of the lines, where 0 is transparent and 1 is fully
            opaque. The default is 0.6.
        colorbar : bool
            If set to True, will color-code the data in the sample column
            `colorbar_col`. Is overridden if `color` is set. The default is
            True, so that every line has a different color.
        colorbar_col : int
            The column in the data samples that will be used to color the
            points. Only has an effect if `colorbar` is set to True. The
            default is 0 (the first column - time).
        colorbar_title : str
            If set, the colorbar will have this title above. The default is
            None.
